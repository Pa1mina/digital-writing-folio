# Week 1
### What do you think digital writing is?
I think it is any form of writing on the internet, but I could be very wrong. I believe that blogs could be digital writing, or even web posts. I believe video games are digital writing. I have never heard of electronic literature before so I am excited to see how it works. 
### What do you expect from the digital writing lab?
I expect to learn a form I have not previously explored or known much about. Digital writing seems like the sort of thing I would usually not enagage with based purely off my own lack of understanding. I am eager to challange myself and learn something new. 
### What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
I usually write short form fiction, usually with horror/thriller/gore elements to it. But I also enjoy screenwriting, also within the same genre. 
### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
I usually use the notes app on my phone to at least start off with an idea, or I utulise it throughout the day when I have an idea. My best writing is achieved when I pull something from my notes to start a word documant off with. 
### Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
I use these tools and techniques mostly out of habit, and because they clearly work for me. 
### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
These tools have only ever assisted me, and facilitated my writing. 
# A Response to the Electronic Literature Collection 
## Volume 1 
### Carving In Possibilities by Deena Larson
There is something quite saddening about this work. I feel as if it captures a time long ago. Both through its subject matter as well as the period in which it was created. It is simplistic in its interactivity, but not at all boring, mostly because it focuses on producing emotionally stimulating prose. 
## Volume 2 
### Still Standing by Bruno Nadeau
I thought it was interesting that we could not interact with this piece, as it was a documantry about the work. Whilst I do understand it to be 'electronic literature' - I do wonder how it can still be considered that if it is merely something that can only be interacted with in person. I guess this is something we will explore throughout class?
## Volume 3 
### The Hunt For The Gay Planet by Anna Anthropy
Initially I thought this was an actual game, but it is text based. It was super fun to play and makes me realise that not all of this stuff needs to be overly complex and it can be obtainable. It makes me positive for my future project. Although, I did find the lack of visuals slightly boring. 
## Volume 4 
### How To Rob A Bank By Alan Bigelow
By far this has been my favourite piece of electronic literature. I absolutely loved the humour and the storytelling. This is something I wish to emmulate aesthetically at least. I will probably talk about the work for the first assignment. 
# Week 2 
Strike/
# Week 3 
## What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?
I read the 'Shade' and although I understood the point of it, I found the work to be incredibly frusturating. I want to understand WHY the story needs to be told. But overall, I do appreicate the work that would have gone into creating something like this. 
## How are those elements meaningful?
I think the subtle responses from the computer in 'Shade' are meaningful in a strange way. The computer not understanding my question after I get something wrong is somewhat symbolic. 
## How are the works read differently from print literature?
To me, it is all about the interactivity. I find myself completely invested in the outcome of the story, where with print, I am simply an observer of the story, not a contributing factor. You also don't get to read passivly when you engage with electronic literature. Everything needs to be taken into account to progress. 
## How is electronic literature different from print literature?
I believe they are similar, not completely different. The level of interactivity is what I believe becomes the main difference. 
## What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic lit
Interactivity. 
# Week 4 
/ 
# Week 5 
## How is it different from fiction?
It might not be fiction. The work could be anything. 
## How is it different from games?
We talked about this in class at length, and everybody kept referencing 'The Last of Us' which even I find to be a perfect example of literature and gaming. I don't think electonic literature is a game persay, however I also believe it always has some level of interactivity. I struggle to answer this question because I believe you can not so easily 'box' electronic literature. 
## How do you plan fiction?
I do not plan my fiction, I simply write and work out things as I go. Maybe this is why I haven't finished a full length novel. 
## How could you plan hypertext fiction?
I struggle to answer this as mentioned above, I do not plan. After learning about interactive fiction and hypertext, I will have no choice but to plan my work out. I need to decide what pattern of hypertext I will use for my future story. 
# Week 6 
### Twine response and idea creation
Planning of an hypertext - 
Two men trying to catfish eachother? 
Omegel 

Man and Man

Man 1 says Hi, ASL? 

Man 1 says, Hi, 19, Female, Melbourne, you? - hypertext - Man, 57, Mums basement. 

Man 2 says - ‘cool, I live in Melbourne too! I’ just turned 20, female.’ - hypertext, Man, 49, Melbourne, specifically, mums basement. 

Man 1 - ‘Wow, we’re so similar! Did you have a good birthday?’ - hypertext ‘similar’ - definition of weirdo

Man 2 - ‘I had an awesome birthday! I spent the night drinking with friends - Hypertext friends - takes you to a reddit post titled ‘Who to spend your birthday with when you have no friends? 

Man 1 - ‘That sounds so fun, you sound pretty popular. I’d love to hangout some time, 
# Week 7 
## Galatea
I found the reading of Galatea way more enjoyable than Shade. Galatea made a lot more sense, and I felt as if there was purpose too it. Maybe I feel like this because I made more progress with it. 
### Using Bitsy 
I don't think I will use Bitsy. I don't think I am advanced enough for it. Right now I am leaning towards Twine, as it seemes easier to learn how to use. My story isn't finalised, I am simply just tossing up ideas. Although I do know I want to expand my prior idea. 
Initially I wanted to mimic something like 'How To Rob A Bank' by Alan Bigelow. My idea was that I would base it around a 'user' that accidently gives his identity away after clicking on a 'Hot Mums Near You' advertisement, but this seems a bit too advanced for my limited knowledge. I don't think Twine is capable of recreating something like How To Rob a Bank, however I am not opposed to this. I need to work out a way to make Twine work for me whilst also remaining excited about my project. 
### Response to Interactive Fiction 
Proposal > 
ASL, Age, Sex, Location, will be a hyperlink text based story, that is loosely based off the online chat forum 'Omegal'. 
In ASL, two strangers conversate with one another and begin to form a friendship, Stranger 1 is not who they appear to be, and the reader is presented with accompanying photographs that are eerie in appearance. This eventually leads to the reader uncovering the death of stranger 2. 
Main issue will be the chat log. How will I make a convincing chat log span over weeks without having my Twine work become too long?
# Week 8 
## Presentations of Proposals 
I am going ahead with my idea and naming the work Hi, ASL. I think it is very much me. It encorporates horror and I will ensure it also provides the user with additional information in some 'found evidence' so that it isn't just chat logs. My main things I need to focus on after presenting is:
I need to seperate my chat logs into weeks to show time passing.
I need to work out if I want my readers to be in the 'know' about Stranger 2s murder, or make it a suprise. 
I need to actually work out how to use Twine without becoming overwhelmed. 
# Week 9 
## Learning how to put images into Twine 
I managed to also put a GIF into Twine from home! 
This is now my updated Chat Log. 
Stranger 1: Hi, ASL? 

Stranger 2: 19, Female, Melbourne, you? 

Stranger 1: 20, Male, Sydney. You sure you’re not some weird [pedo] pretending to be a girl? 

Stranger 2: Haha, real funny. I could say the same about you, [stranger]

Stranger 1: Well, I’m a real [boy] (Pinocchio picture) 

Stranger 2: [[Prove it]] 


May 7th 2006  18:54 

Stranger 2: You swear that’s [[you?]]

Stranger 1: Why would I [[lie?]]

Stranger 2: I’m not sure. I guess I just doubt good things could [[happen to me]] sometimes. 

Stranger 1:  Believe it. [[I promise]] I’m even better in person [[ ;)]]

Stranger 2: Lol, cocky much? Did you like the photos of me?

Stranger 1: I did. You know I’m into blonds? And your hair looks so soft. What shampoo do you use? Is that [[weird]] to ask? 

Stranger 2:  It’s Garnier Fructus fruits in Green apple. Don’t worry, I like [[weird.]]

Stranger 1: Really? Somehow that makes this better. 

Stranger 2: Makes what better?

Stranger 1: [[Us]] 


May 8th 2006 12:09

Stranger 2: Why won’t you reply to my snapchats? I hate talking to you on this, like we’re [[strangers.]]

Stranger 1: Keeps logging me out. We’re not strangers. Soon enough I will know you from the [[Inside out.]]

[[Stranger 2 is typing….]]

Stranger 2: I have to [[go]], i’ll message you soon.

May 9th 2006 4:23 

Stranger 1: Hello? 

May 10th 2006 12:01

Stranger 1: Hello? I washed my hair last night with your shampoo. My pillow smells just like you. I miss you. Sorry if I scared you. 

May 11th 2006 1:32 

Stranger 2: [[Hey.]] 

Stranger 1: Did I make you [[uncomfortable?]]

Stranger 2: A bit. But not in the way you think. I haven’t felt like this before. Wanted, I mean. [[I’m scared]] I’m starting to like you.

Stranger 1: Who wouldn’t want you?  The thought of you consumes me. I hate how far away we are from one another. [[I want to keep you with me forever.]]

May 21st 16:13

Stranger 2: I had a dream about [[you]] last night. 

Stranger 1: A good one I hope [[ ;)]]

Stranger 2: It was strange. We were existing in the space of nothingness, I wasn’t even a person, just an orb. I felt your presence, it was small at first, like a pulsating glow in the darkness, and I swam towards you. 

Stranger 1: And then? 

Stranger 2: You were quick like a fly, hard to catch. But when we finally collided, you grew, pulsating and pulsating like lungs breathing in air. Your glow was vibrant like a thousand suns, and then, before I could fathom what was happening, you collapsed inwards, and a darkness emerged. [[I was sucked right in.]] You snuffed the life right out of me. 

[[Stranger 1 is typing …]] 

[[Stranger 1 is typing… ]]

[[Stranger 1 has logged off.]]

May 15th 2006 22:45

Stranger 2: I’m so sorry for dumping that on you. I don’t know what came over me. It was just a stupid, stupid dream. I’ve been so anxious to meet you, you know? Sometimes I mistake anxiety for gut instinct. Please don’t [[leave me.]]

May 17th 

Stranger 1: Hello. 

Stranger2: Hi! Hey?? I’ve missed [[you]] so much. 

Stranger 1: I want you to come to Sydney. [[I want to meet you.]]

Stranger 2: When? [[I’m afraid]] you won’t like me in real life. I want so badly to please you. 

Stranger 1: [[You will please me,]] I’m sure of it. Come and stay with me.

Stranger 2: At your [[house?]]

Stranger 1: Yes. I live right off Bondi Beach. It’s beautiful here. You will wake up to the smell of salt and sea, the sound of seagulls and laughter. And we would finally be together, forever. 

Stranger 2: If I come, I don’t think i’ll want to leave. 

Stranger 1: Don’t worry, I won’t let you. X 


May 25th 2006 13:24

Stranger 2: I’m about to catch my train. But you wouldn’t believe what happened to me as I walked to the station. I swallowed a fly! It was buzzing all around me, i tried to shoo it away to no avail, until finally it landed on my lips. I yelped, and it flew right in. I think I can feel it now, thrashing [[inside of me.]] Or maybe that’s just butterflies x 

Stranger 2: I’m 2 hours away. I’m so scared to meet you. I hope you like me, [[I hope I make you happy.]]

Stranger 2: I’m here, where are you? I’m by the bus shelter, I’m wearing a pink top, can you see me? Or [[am I lost?]]

Stranger 1 has disconnected from the chat. 

Overall, I am worried that it is a bit quick of a relationship. However, I do think that with the added documants I will include, the story might make more sense, or even read slower? 
# Week 10
I was away, but i attempted to make the website and failed. So, instead I watched Youtube Videos on Twine to try and at least be proactive. 
I have been watching DigitalExposureTV, and using Reddit. Somehow everything is becoming easier to use. And I am actually enjoying the process. 
# WEEK 11 
## PROBLEMS!!!
Since I am working within a very sensative subject matter (murder) I am finding it hard to source images that are not ACTUALLY real. People or organisations have actually uploaded real crime scene images to be used even under the Creative Commons on Google images. Ethically, I don't think it is okay to incoporate such things within my work. Although I love horror and enjoy distrubing content, I like it if it is Fiction only. Using an actual person's truama in my work is not an option, but I am struggling to find images that suit my aesthetics. For example, I really wanted to incorporate elements of Analog Horror within my work. Because it is such a niche part of the internet, finding images that fall under creative commons is basically impossible. I will have to start making my own images/videos to fit the aesthetic. 
# WEEK 12 
After talking to Ben and expressing my concerns, I have decided to try to use AI to create my photos. I have never used it before for anything so I will have to see how it goes. 
## UPDATE* 
AI is a no go. It doesn't understand that analog horror is more than just VHS, and instead of just heavily distorting images, it still attempts to make them somewhat 'pretty'. I don't want to get into a major conversation about what AI can and can't do, but I don't believe it shares my vision. 
# WEEK 13 
## Final WEEK!
### Reflection on class - 
Initially, I believed Digital writing was another way of describing blogging, online journaling, digital zines, or any piece of writing accessed through a computer. Obviously, this assessment was wrong. In my first digital writing class after learning what it was, I felt overwhelmed and slightly disinterested. Computers and coding are things I have never been interested in, and something I struggle with. I felt as if I would not be able to overcome my self described ‘computer illiteracy’. However, after interacting with forms of digital writing such as ‘How to Rob A Bank’ by Alan Bigelow, I became excited by the prospects of the class. The tasks we were given throughout the semester encouraged creativity, and being able to design a story without creative limits was something I have found I have not been able to do in a lot of my other classes throughout my bachelor. I just had to overcome my apprehension for coding. I chose to focus on Twine for my work because to me it was the easiest to learn. This was in no way a ‘cop out’ but more so an introduction for me. The more I began to use Twine, the easier it became. I found myself towards the end of my project moving through it quickly. My practice has developed immensely because of the class. I am the sort of person who loves epistolary novels and games, especially when they are in the genre of horror. Being able to create one with added sound effects and visuals has been a game changer. Although I think going forth, I will be able to produce more effective works as I learn more about twine, for a first project I am proud with how it turned out. What I love most about interactive fiction is the interactivity. I think we all love interactivity to a certain degree. We play board games or card games, video games, or read novels with a ‘choose your own adventure’ option, so interactive fiction allows anybody to be able to create something akin to these. Professionally, I believe the class has helped immensely. Learning about accessibility and basic coding practices can be really beneficial after graduation, and I now understand how websites work a little bit more, whereas before I was completely unaware. I might be able to use twine in a future business endeavour, or just for my own creativity.
