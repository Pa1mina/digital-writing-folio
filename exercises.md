# Week 1
### What do you think digital writing is?
I think it is any form of writing on the internet, but I could be very wrong. I believe that blogs could be digital writing, or even web posts. I believe video games are digital writing. I have never heard of electronic literature before so I am excited to see how it works. 
### What do you expect from the digital writing lab?
I expect to learn a form I have not previously explored or known much about. Digital writing seems like the sort of thing I would usually not enagage with based purely off my own lack of understanding. I am eager to challange myself and learn something new. 
### What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
I usually write short form fiction, usually with horror/thriller/gore elements to it. But I also enjoy screenwriting, also within the same genre. 
### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
I usually use the notes app on my phone to at least start off with an idea, or I utulise it throughout the day when I have an idea. My best writing is achieved when I pull something from my notes to start a word documant off with. 
### Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
I use these tools and techniques mostly out of habit, and because they clearly work for me. 
### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
These tools have only ever assisted me, and facilitated my writing. 
# A Response to the Electronic Literature Collection 
## Volume 1 
### Carving In Possibilities by Deena Larson
There is something quite saddening about this work. I feel as if it captures a time long ago. Both through its subject matter as well as the period in which it was created. It is simplistic in its interactivity, but not at all boring, mostly because it focuses on producing emotionally stimulating prose. 
## Volume 2 
### Still Standing by Bruno Nadeau
I thought it was interesting that we could not interact with this piece, as it was a documantry about the work. Whilst I do understand it to be 'electronic literature' - I do wonder how it can still be considered that if it is merely something that can only be interacted with in person. I guess this is something we will explore throughout class?
## Volume 3 
### The Hunt For The Gay Planet by Anna Anthropy
Initially I thought this was an actual game, but it is text based. It was super fun to play and makes me realise that not all of this stuff needs to be overly complex and it can be obtainable. It makes me positive for my future project. Although, I did find the lack of visuals slightly boring. 
## Volume 4 
### How To Rob A Bank By Alan Bigelow
By far this has been my favourite piece of electronic literature. I absolutely loved the humour and the storytelling. This is something I wish to emmulate aesthetically at least. I will probably talk about the work for the first assignment.

# Week 3 
## What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?
I read the 'Shade' and although I understood the point of it, I found the work to be incredibly frusturating. I want to understand WHY the story needs to be told. But overall, I do appreicate the work that would have gone into creating something like this. 
## How are those elements meaningful?
I think the subtle responses from the computer in 'Shade' are meaningful in a strange way. The computer not understanding my question after I get something wrong is somewhat symbolic. 
## How are the works read differently from print literature?
To me, it is all about the interactivity. I find myself completely invested in the outcome of the story, where with print, I am simply an observer of the story, not a contributing factor. You also don't get to read passivly when you engage with electronic literature. Everything needs to be taken into account to progress. 
## How is electronic literature different from print literature?
I believe they are similar, not completely different. The level of interactivity is what I believe becomes the main difference. 
## What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic lit
Interactivity.

# Week 5 
## How is it different from fiction?
It might not be fiction. The work could be anything. 
## How is it different from games?
We talked about this in class at length, and everybody kept referencing 'The Last of Us' which even I find to be a perfect example of literature and gaming. I don't think electonic literature is a game persay, however I also believe it always has some level of interactivity. I struggle to answer this question because I believe you can not so easily 'box' electronic literature. 
## How do you plan fiction?
I do not plan my fiction, I simply write and work out things as I go. Maybe this is why I haven't finished a full length novel. 
## How could you plan hypertext fiction?
I struggle to answer this as mentioned above, I do not plan. After learning about interactive fiction and hypertext, I will have no choice but to plan my work out. I need to decide what pattern of hypertext I will use for my future story. 
# Week 6 
### Twine response and idea creation
Planning of an hypertext - 
Two men trying to catfish eachother? 
Omegel 

Man and Man

Man 1 says Hi, ASL? 

Man 1 says, Hi, 19, Female, Melbourne, you? - hypertext - Man, 57, Mums basement. 

Man 2 says - ‘cool, I live in Melbourne too! I’ just turned 20, female.’ - hypertext, Man, 49, Melbourne, specifically, mums basement. 

Man 1 - ‘Wow, we’re so similar! Did you have a good birthday?’ - hypertext ‘similar’ - definition of weirdo

Man 2 - ‘I had an awesome birthday! I spent the night drinking with friends - Hypertext friends - takes you to a reddit post titled ‘Who to spend your birthday with when you have no friends? 

Man 1 - ‘That sounds so fun, you sound pretty popular. I’d love to hangout some time, 
# Week 7 
### Using Bitsy 
I don't think I will use Bitsy. I don't think I am advanced enough for it. Right now I am leaning towards Twine, as it seemes easier to learn how to use. My story isn't finalised, I am simply just tossing up ideas. Although I do know I want to expand my prior idea. 
Initially I wanted to mimic something like 'How To Rob A Bank' by Alan Bigelow. My idea was that I would base it around a 'user' that accidently gives his identity away after clicking on a 'Hot Mums Near You' advertisement, but this seems a bit too advanced for my limited knowledge. I don't think Twine is capable of recreating something like How To Rob a Bank, however I am not opposed to this. I need to work out a way to make Twine work for me whilst also remaining excited about my project. 
### Response to Interactive Fiction 
Proposal > 
ASL, Age, Sex, Location, will be a hyperlink text based story, that is loosely based off the online chat forum 'Omegal'. 
In ASL, two strangers conversate with one another and begin to form a friendship, Stranger 1 is not who they appear to be, and the reader is presented with accompanying photographs that are eerie in appearance. This eventually leads to the reader uncovering the death of stranger 2. 
Main issue will be the chat log. How will I make a convincing chat log span over weeks without having my Twine work become too long?
# Week 8 
## Presentations of Proposals 
I am going ahead with my idea and naming the work Hi, ASL. I think it is very much me. It encorporates horror and I will ensure it also provides the user with additional information in some 'found evidence' so that it isn't just chat logs. My main things I need to focus on after presenting is:
I need to seperate my chat logs into weeks to show time passing.
I need to work out if I want my readers to be in the 'know' about Stranger 2s murder, or make it a suprise. 
I need to actually work out how to use Twine without becoming overwhelmed.
