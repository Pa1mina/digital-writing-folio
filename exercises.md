# Week 1
### What do you think digital writing is?
I think it is any form of writing on the internet, but I could be very wrong. I believe that blogs could be digital writing, or even web posts. I believe video games are digital writing. I have never heard of electronic literature before so I am excited to see how it works. 
### What do you expect from the digital writing lab?
I expect to learn a form I have not previously explored or known much about. Digital writing seems like the sort of thing I would usually not enagage with based purely off my own lack of understanding. I am eager to challange myself and learn something new. 
### What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
I usually write short form fiction, usually with horror/thriller/gore elements to it. But I also enjoy screenwriting, also within the same genre. 
### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
I usually use the notes app on my phone to at least start off with an idea, or I utulise it throughout the day when I have an idea. My best writing is achieved when I pull something from my notes to start a word documant off with. 
### Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
I use these tools and techniques mostly out of habit, and because they clearly work for me. 
### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
These tools have only ever assisted me, and facilitated my writing.

Proposal > 
ASL, Age, Sex, Location, will be a hyperlink text based story, that is loosely based off the online chat forum 'Omegal'. 
In ASL, two strangers conversate with one another and begin to form a friendship, Stranger 1 is not who they appear to be, and the reader is presented with accompanying photographs that are eerie in appearance. This eventually leads to the reader uncovering the death of stranger 2.
