# Week 1
### What do you think digital writing is?
I think it is any form of writing on the internet, but I could be very wrong. I believe that blogs could be digital writing, or even web posts. I believe video games are digital writing. I have never heard of electronic literature before so I am excited to see how it works. 
### What do you expect from the digital writing lab?
I expect to learn a form I have not previously explored or known much about. Digital writing seems like the sort of thing I would usually not enagage with based purely off my own lack of understanding. I am eager to challange myself and learn something new. 
### What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
I usually write short form fiction, usually with horror/thriller/gore elements to it. But I also enjoy screenwriting, also within the same genre. 
### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
I usually use the notes app on my phone to at least start off with an idea, or I utulise it throughout the day when I have an idea. My best writing is achieved when I pull something from my notes to start a word documant off with. 
### Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
I use these tools and techniques mostly out of habit, and because they clearly work for me. 
### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
These tools have only ever assisted me, and facilitated my writing.
