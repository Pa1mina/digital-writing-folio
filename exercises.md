### What do you think digital writing is?
I think it is any form of writing on the internet, but i could be very wrong. I believe that blogs could be digital writing, or even web posts. 
### What do you expect from the digital writing lab?

### What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?

### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

### Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
